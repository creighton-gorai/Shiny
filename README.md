### What can Shiny make?

Shiny has many examples of different types of Data Visualizations. Below are a few pictures of what types of graphs you can make with Shiny.

_Movie Explorer_
![movie-explorer](movie-explorer.png)

The graph above shows us movies that were made from 1970 - 2014, that made between $0 - $800m, and have a minimum of 10 - 80 rotten tomatoe reviews. You might also notice which movies have won an oscar.

_World Cloud_

This is just a world cloud from the book A Mid Summer Night's Dream where the words need to have a frequency of 1 - 15 and there can only be a maximum of 100 words that can be shown at one time.

_Zipcode Explorer_

- They offer video and written tutorials on Shiny!

_Let's take a look at Lesson 1 "Welcome to Shiny"_

If you are new to R you can learn more about it bu clicking [here](https://www.r-project.org/).<br/>
I will also provide a link to the download page [here](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).<br/>

The Steps below are to get R running on your computer and testing Shiny.<br/>

Steps:
1) Choose server closest to your location.
2) Choose which OS you are using.
3) Click on the package that follows with which situation you would like to download R for.
4) Once downloaded open R and it should look like a terminal.
5) type `install.packages("shiny")`. This will install all shiny packages into R.
6) Then type `library(shiny)` and `runExample("01_hello")`.<br/>
7) To exit press `esc` on your keyboard.
This will open up the example of their hello world project using Shiny and R for you to view.<br/>
There are other examples you may run by viewing this document [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/#Go%20Further).

In the end Shiny will look like the following pictures below:

### Shiny with other Data Vis. APIs

Shiny can be used with other libraries in R by inputting `library(name_of_library)` (Ex: library(shiny)). This will allow use of another library in R. Since you can add multiple libraries in R you can use Shiny with other Javascript libraries such as d3, Leaflet, and Google Charts.
