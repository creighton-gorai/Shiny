## What can Shiny do?

### Shiny with R programming

If you are new to R you can learn more about it with the link above.<br/>
I will also provide a link to the download page [here](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)<br/>
The Steps below are to get R running on your computer and test.<br/>

Steps:
1) Choose server closest to your location.
2) Choose which OS you are using
3) Click on the package that follows with which situation you would like to download R for.
4) Once downloaded open R and it should look like a terminal
5) type `install.packages("shiny")`. This will install all shiny packages into R.
6) Then type `library(shiny)` and `runExample("01_hello")`<br/>
This will open up the example of their hello world project using Shiny and R for you to view.<br/>
There are other examples you may run by viewing this document [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/#Go%20Further).

### Shiny with other Data Vis. APIs

Shiny can be used with other libraries in R by inputting `library(name_of_library)` (Ex: library(shiny)). This will allow use of another library in R. Since you can add multiple libraries in R you can use Shiny with other Javascript libraries such as d3, Leaflet, and Google Charts.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/creighton-gorai/Shiny/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
